<table>

<tr>

<td> Personal Homepage(Jan 2015)</td>
<td> Created personal homepage using HTML and added style to my webpage with CSS file to display fundamental information.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Cross-Validation Nearest-Neighbors(Oct 2014)</td>
<td> Wrote a program to implement cross validation evaluation of the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm with two input files which one contains cross validation and the other contains data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> AdaBoosting(Dec 2014)</td>
<td> Implemented binary AdaBoosting and real AdaBoosting algorithms in T iterations via weak classifiers to output results with one input file containing data.
</tr>


<tr>
<td> Fountain Simulation(Dec 2014)</td>
<td>Achieved dynamic simulation of a water fountain based on basic principles of particle system using OpenGL. Used random movements of particles to simulate fountain irregular movements. Modified water particle parameters to implement different shapes.
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Visualization of U.S. Highways(May 2014)</td>
<td>Collected U.S. highway routes' texts from Wikipedia and preprocessed them into different segmentations. Extracted time and location information with Stanford Named Entity Recognizer(NER), SENNA tools and technique of predicate-argument structure with mapping rules. Used Javascript amMap to generate interactive maps for displaying results.
